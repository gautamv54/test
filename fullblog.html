                <p>When I think about the best programming languages to learn, Java is near the top of the list.
                   The language has a wide range of use cases and a beginner-friendly syntax that makes it a great language to learn. 
                   While Java may be older than some languages like Ruby or Python, it’s a valuable skill to have if you’re willing to devote the
                    time to learning Java.
                  </p>
        <p>Java is an incredibly versatile language. It’s used for everything from games development to Windows application development. 
          Minecraft, for example, has been built using Java since the first version of the game. All the apps on Android phones are written in Java; 
          it’s everywhere!</p>
    
        <p>There’s no limits with what you can do with Java once you master the basics. 
          If you’re new to the language, you may be asking yourself: how do I learn java and 
          what are the basic 
          Java topics that I should learn?</p>
    
    
        <p>In this guide, we’ve prepared a quick list of tutorials on Java. These tutorials will help you kickstart your journey to learning Java.
           Let’s begin!</p>
        <h2>What is Java?</h2>
        <p>Java is a programming language that was built by software engineers at Sun Microsystems. 
          It’s object-oriented, like languages such as Python, and is multi-purpose. The language is based on many 
          ideas from the C++ programming language, but it’s arguably much easier to use.</p>
    
        <p>Java has decades of history, which means there’s no shortage of guides out
           there which can help you as you encounter errors, debug your programs, and seek to expand your skills.</p>
    
    
        <h2>Java Data Types</h2>
        <p>Every variable in Java must be assigned a data type. There are a wide range of data types that
           you can assign to a variable such as a character, a floating-point number, and a string.</p>
    
        <h3 >Java Variables</h3>
        
        <p>Variables are containers that hold a particular value. A variable can store any type of data.
           Once a data type is set for a variable, it cannot be changed.</p>
        <h3>Java Strings</h3>
    
        <p>Strings are used to represent text-based data. Once a string has been declared,
           you can manipulate it using Java. You can reverse strings, merge strings, find characters in a string using Java’s string methods.</p>
        <h3>Java Arrays</h3>
    
        <p>Arrays can store multiple values in a single variable. A list of bird breeds could be stored 
          in an array; a list of cookies could be stored in an array. Storing data in an array helps improve the readability of your code.</p>
    
        <p>Once you store values in an array, you can use loops to perform an action on all the values inside that array.</p>
    
        <h2 >Java Conditionals and Loops</h2>
    
        <p>Conditional statements allow you to run a block of code only when a particular condition is met. 
          Loops automate repetitive tasks in a program.</p>
        <h3 >Java if...else</h3>
    
        <p>The “if...else” statement allows you to check if a statement is true or false,
           and run code depending on its outcome. You can use an “else if” statement to check for multiple 
           conditions, and an “else” statement to run code if no condition is met.</p>
        <h3 >Java While Loop</h3>
    
        <p>While loops run a block of code until a condition evaluates to false. 
          They are used when you don’t know how many times a loop will need to execute.</p>
        <h3 >Java For Loop</h3>
    
        <p>For loops allow you to automate repetitive tasks. They execute
           a block of code for a predetermined number of times. Often, for loops are used to iterate through a list or a range of values.</p>
    
        <h2 >Java Objects and Classes</h2>
    
        <p>Methods are used to bundle together particular tasks inside your code.
           Classes are used to define how an object – which is an instance of a class – should be structured.</p>
    
        <h3 >Java Methods</h3>
    
        <p>A method is a block of code. It is only executed when the method is called.
           Methods are useful because they allow you to define a block of code once and use it multiple times.</p>
    
        <h3 >Java Classes and Objects</h3>
    
        <p>Java is object-oriented which means the language relies heavily on objects and classes. 
          A class tells a program how an object should be structured. 
          It defines what values and methods are accessible to objects that use the blueprint defined by a class.</p>
    
        <h3 >Java Inheritance</h3>
    
        <p>Inheritance is a key pillar of object-oriented programming.
           It is used to help you reduce repetition in your code. 
           Inheritance allows classes to inherit values and methods from other classes.</p>
    
        <h2 >Next Steps on Your Journey</h2>
    
        <p>We’ve covered the basics of Java but there is so much more to learn.
           When people say that learning how to code is a life-long journey, they are not lying.</p>
    
        <p>If you have already mastered the concepts above, congratulate yourself!
           That’s a big accomplishment. We’ve prepared a few tutorials to help you refine your skills even more:</p>
        <ul>
    
        <li>Defining an abstract class in Java></li>
        <li>Comparing strings in Java</li>
        <li>Exception handling using try/catch</li>
        <li>Using the ternary operator</li>
        <li>Working with files using the File class</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Good luck on your journey to learning Java! Here is a list of top Java courses you can take.
           There may be tough times. Keep reminding yourself that you are learning a skill that you’ll be 
           able to use for the rest of your life!</p>
